Best Practices
- All resources are defined in the serverless.yml file
   -
Architecture
- Data is stored in a DynamoDB table "todos" which has a composite key (todoId, userId), where todoId is the partition key and userId is the sort key
- A Global Index is maintained on this table with the userId as the partition key.
- A partition key of "userId" ensures all todos for a users lie in the same partition in this index
- We use this index to returns all todos for a user
- The partition key of "todoId" on the todos table, ensures we can update and delete a to-do item. The global index propagates this change the userId index
- The getTodos API fetches all to-dos for a user using the userId of the user using the index
- The userId for a user is taken from the JWT payload (sub field) automatically from the provided JWT
